# FermatCY

This repository contains the Mathematica code used to generate the data on Fermat-type Calabi-Yau four-folds used in the paper <i>"The Tadpole Conjecture in the Interior of Moduli Space"</i> by S. Lüst and M. Wiesner.

## Content

- Fermat.nb: The main Mathematica notebook that contains all relevant code to reproduce the results and figures from the paper.
- cydata.txt: A database of 609 Fermat-type Calabi-Yau four-folds with $h^{3,1}=h^{3,1}_\text{poly}$ and $h^{3,1} - h^{3,1}_\text{inv} < 5000$.
